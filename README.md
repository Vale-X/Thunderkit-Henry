# Thunderkit-Henry (EARLY RELEASE)
**This is an EARLY RELEASE of ThunderHenry, a ThunderKit based template for survivors. This template DOES NOT have WWise setup, meaning custom sounds are NOT POSSIBLE with this version of the template. A future release will have WWise support.**

See the [ThunderHenry Wiki](https://github.com/Vale-X/Thunderkit-Henry/wiki/Creating-Survivors-with-ThunderHenry) for a WORK IN PROGRESS tutorial on how to use this template, and how to create ThunderKit survivors in general.

## About Beta Branch
The Beta branch for this project is just for me to upload WIP updates and project changes, and isn't recommended to use as a template for your own characters. Use the Main Branch as a template instead. When updates are ready to be used in templates, it will be pushed to the main branch.

## Changelog

__Major Update 1__
- The project now uses `ThunderKit v4.1.1` and `R2API v3.0.59`.
- The project now uses `StubbedShaderConverter v1.0.0` as a package instead of a local install.
- Added `Shaders.cs`, for using ShaderConverter and also creating a list of all materials in the proejct.
